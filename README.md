## Data Integrity

**The Quran is sacred, and accuracy is non-negotiable.**

This project does NOT use AI/LLM to generate, translate, or modify any Quranic text. All Arabic text, translations, and transliteration are taken **verbatim** from [Tanzil.net](https://tanzil.net) — a trusted, peer-reviewed source used by scholars worldwide.

| Data | Source | AI-Generated? |
|------|--------|---------------|
| Arabic text | Tanzil.net (quran-simple) | No |
| English translation | Tanzil.net (Sahih International) | No |
| Transliteration | Tanzil.net | No |
| Word-by-word analysis | LLM-generated | Yes |

**Where AI is used:**
1. **Word analysis** — Linguistic breakdown (roots, grammar, morphology) generated by local LLM, stored in `public/data/analysis/`
2. **Practice feedback** — Comparing your translation attempt against the authentic Tanzil.net translation

The LLM never touches the source text. It only provides supplementary learning aids.

## Acknowledgments

- Quranic text and translations from [Tanzil.net](https://tanzil.net) — distributed verbatim, unmodified
